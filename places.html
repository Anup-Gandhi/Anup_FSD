                <h2>Shaniwar Wada</h2>
                <p>Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune. Built in 1732, it was the seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818 when the Peshwas lost control to the British East India Company. The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the remaining structures are now maintained as a tourist site.</p>
